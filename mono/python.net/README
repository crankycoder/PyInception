This is a cython binding to Mono to allow integration of .NET managed
code with CPython.

Basic functionality includes:

1) Construction of .NET classes
2) Invocation of object methods
3) Value-type attributes
4) Reference type attributes

Not supported (yet anyway)

* callback functions
    
    This should be possible with a little bit of cython code
    generation, but I'm not going to worry right now
